The following states are implemented:

* building => blue
* success => green
* fatal errors => red
* no fatal errors ("unstable") => yellow


## Configuration

1. Create a new user one the hue bridge (http://developers.meethue.com/gettingstarted.html)
2. Open Global Setting and set the
  * IP address of the hue bridge
  * Authorized username of the hue bridge
3. Create a new job or modify an existing job
  * Add post-build action **Colorize Hue-Light**
  * Set the id of the light you want to control


## Ã…F fork

Implementing support for multiple bridges. Global settings of bridge IP and
user are now defaults. Each individual job has settings for bridge IP and user
in post-build action.

Implementing support for pipeline scripts. Format is presented in the Snippet
Generator.
